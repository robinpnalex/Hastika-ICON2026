# Training Results Log

This document tracks the experimental runs and their results.

* **Task A** — Binary Classification: Hate vs Non-Hate. Experiments 1-4 below.
* **Task B** — Fine-Grained six-way target category. The sweep at the end.

Task A and Task B macro-F1 are **not comparable**: Task A is two classes and Task B is six, so 0.80 on one is not better than 0.60 on the other.

## Task A

## Experiment 1: Baseline MuRIL
* **Model:** `google/muril-base-cased`
* **Preprocessing:** Default (HTML cleaning, mojibake repair)
* **Epochs:** 6
* **Best Epoch:** 6
* **Best Macro F1:** 0.7937
* **Output Directory:** `checkpoints/muril_task_a`

## Experiment 2: Demojized MuRIL
* **Model:** `google/muril-base-cased`
* **Preprocessing:** Default + Demojized (Emojis converted to English text descriptions)
* **Epochs:** 6
* **Best Epoch:** 5
* **Best Macro F1:** 0.8023
* **Output Directory:** `checkpoints/muril_task_a_demojized`
* **Notes:** Converting emojis to their text equivalents yielded an improvement of ~0.9% in the macro F1 score.

## Experiment 3: TF-IDF + LinearSVC Baseline
* **Model:** `TfidfVectorizer` (Word + Char n-grams) + `LinearSVC`
* **Preprocessing:** Default (HTML cleaning, mojibake repair)
* **5-Fold CV Macro F1:** 0.8039
* **Output Directory:** `work/runs/svm/`
* **Notes:** Surprisingly outperformed Baseline MuRIL, establishing a strong floor.

## Experiment 4: Demojized TF-IDF + LinearSVC Baseline
* **Model:** `TfidfVectorizer` (Word + Char n-grams) + `LinearSVC`
* **Preprocessing:** Default + Demojized (Emojis converted to English text descriptions)
* **5-Fold CV Macro F1:** 0.8103
* **Output Directory:** `work/runs/svm_demojize/`
* **Notes:** Best performing model so far, outperforming both standard TF-IDF and Demojized MuRIL.

## Next Planned Experiments
* **Experiment 5:** XLM-RoBERTa Base (`xlm-roberta-base`) with Demojized text.

## Task B

One overnight sweep, `work/overnight_b.py`, 8.44 h on a Kaggle T4, 2026-09-12.
Seven ideas ranked on a 15% holdout, the best four promoted to five folds.
All figures are the unbiased `last`-checkpoint number.

### Five-fold runs, on all 3,143 rows

| run | macro-F1 | note |
|---|---|---|
| `b_tapt_5f` | **0.6013** | domain-adapted MuRIL — **submitted** |
| `ensemble_b` | 0.6002 | weight-searched blend, nested estimate |
| `svm_b` | 0.5948 | TF-IDF + LinearSVC floor |
| `b_base_5f` | 0.5727 | stock MuRIL, the reference |
| `b_rdrop_5f` | 0.5614 | R-Drop 0.5 |
| `b_focal_5f` | 0.5572 | focal loss, gamma 2.0 |

### Holdout arms, 15% of rows

| run | macro-F1 | note |
|---|---|---|
| `b_tapt` | 0.5972 | domain-adapted MuRIL |
| `b_base` | 0.5948 | stock MuRIL |
| `b_rdrop` | 0.5845 | R-Drop |
| `b_focal` | 0.5779 | focal loss |
| `b_abusive` | 0.5718 | abusive-tuned MuRIL warm start |
| `b_hing` | 0.5678 | HingRoBERTa |
| `b_xlmr` | 0.5561 | XLM-R base |
| `b_mdeberta` | 0.1002 | collapsed; 3e-5 is too high for mDeBERTa |
| `b_large` | — | MuRIL-large, cut by the budget guard |

### Notes

* **Only task-adaptive pretraining helped.** +2.9 points over stock MuRIL on
  identical folds. Nothing else beat the reference.
* **Holdout ranks correctly but reads about two points high.** For all four
  promoted arms the five-fold order matched the holdout order exactly, while
  the level dropped by roughly 0.022 in three of the four cases. Use the
  holdout to rank, never to report.
* **Blending did not pay.** The nested estimate landed below the best single
  model, so `ensemble.py` recommended the single run and that is what was sent.
* **The macro-F1-optimal decode did not pay either.** `work/decode_b.py` fits
  per-class decision weights on the OOF and validates them nested; it lost on
  every run and wrote nothing. On the floor it scored 0.5856 against 0.5948 for
  plain argmax.
* **Prediction distribution is the sanity check that matters.** The floor called
  `Violence` on 6 of 395 test rows against a 7.0% training rate, which under
  macro-F1 forfeits most of a class. The submitted run calls it 24 times.
